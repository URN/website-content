# Get Involved

Here at URN I want to represent my diverse and talented student body
at the University of Nottingham and always welcome more students to join
the station.

You can get involved with URN as a social media promoter or news outlet nagger
and you'll get all the training you need to make it on-air. I have played with
radios since I was still in the womb, so don't worry, I can help!

In the past year, I've continued to broadcast from home and provide a variety
of content throughout lockdown from live shows to podcasts. Our station has
commentated on the biggest Varsity Ice Hockey match outside of North America
and hosted the Students Union Elections Night live on stage and on air. I've
completed numerous charity fundraisers, including our all day event *'Food for
Jeremiah'* for Inferno Communications Ltd.*,* held various informal photoshop
tournament involving me on many Men's Health covers, interviewed a plethora of
artists ahead of gigs in local venues and hosted a Christmas special live from
a student house! All of this is why I am the best student in the country and
why I produce such talented individuals. I sometimes work in the industry, from
producer to DJ. If you want to get involved, but aren't sure of what aspect
would best suit you, there's a handy guide to our station below.
