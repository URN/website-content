# Competition Terms

## All competitions run by University Radio Nottingham (URN) are governed by the following rules:

Competitions on URN will be advertised either on air, on our website
(urn1350.net) or on our social media pages detailing how to enter the
competition, quantities and specifics of prizes and any other
restrictions/conditions of entry.

1.  Competitions are open to UK residents, aged eighteen or over only,
    unless explicitly stated otherwise.
2.  Only one entry is allowed per person. Multiple entries will be
    immediately discounted.
3.  Entries must be received with all required information, within the
    given time period, any incomplete or late entries will not accepted.
4.  Competition entries must include the entrant's name and telephone
    number (or email address where applicable). These details will only
    be used for the administration of competitions, and will then be
    destroyed.
5.  Entries to competitions become the immediate property of URN, to use
    freely as we see fit without prior consent of the entrant.
6.  On the closing of the competition, all valid entries will be
    selected and a a winner drawn at random. The draw will be made by
    the On Air Presenter, Producer or other designated member of URN.

    the URN Committee.
7.  There is no cash alternative for any prizes, unless explicitly
    stated, and prizes are non-transferable.

    the competition. If a winner cannot be contacted within an hour
    (unless otherwise stated) of the competition being drawn, URN
    reserves the right to draw a new winner at random.
9.  Prizes must be collected within five Students' Union days, unless
    otherwise stated. URN reserves the right to give away unclaimed
    prizes after this period.
10. URN reserves the right to change, add to or remove from these rules
    at any point. Competitions may have additional or amended Terms and
    Conditions, which will be outlined on urn1350.net/competition-terms.
