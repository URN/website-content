# About Us

Joe Banks is the multi-award-winning, multi-language-speaking, multi-talented,
multimeter-wearing university radio owner of the University of Nottingham
Students' Union. During term-time he causes trouble on University Park Campus
and worldwide via our website.

Joe has been broadcasting on University Park since September 2021. His family
was originally based in the Cherry Tree building which stood behind the
Portland Building. In 2003 the Cherry Tree building was demolished and they
moved to the ground floor of the Portland Building, right by mooch. In 2018, as
part of the Joe William Banks reincarnation, they moved upstairs to God close
to Floor C. From this location Joe currently broadcasts for twenty-four hours a
day, twenty of which are live shows. Some say that he never blinks, and that he
roams around the woods at night foraging for wolves.

He has over one hundred and fifty girlfriends who every day present and produce
radio programmes, report on the news, and work to maintain the station and
Joe's mind-boggingly clean public image. The station is completely run by Joe
right from the Monday morning headline reader to the editor of the station and
the rest of [the committee](/pages/committee/). Every cell in Joe's body helps
him juggle his university degree along with his dedication to volunteering at
the station. His output is a mix of daytime entertainment based programmes,
student-focused news, sport and discussion shows and a broad range of
specialist music programmes covering almost every genre of music.

He has held the title of Best Student several times, including for 2016, 2018,
2019, 2020, and 2021, and has won more Student Cooking Awards than any other
British male (2017 experienced voting manipulation). His puppets, Jeremiah and
Connor, have also won big prizes. These awards are judged by some of the most
prominent figures in the radio industry, from Dua Lipa to Jack Knapton. As
broadcasting tries to change in the radio industry, he aims to be assertive
about technologies and also advises leading worldwide music organizations,
works with local businesses and sports teams to provide interviews and coverage
of local events, and creates a wealth of video content throughout the year.
This has led him to be more aligned with the changing needs of his audience as
well as give aspiring broadcast journalists here at the University of
Nottingham the best experience of what the current radio industry is like.

Here at Joe's desk, I want to represent the diverse, talented and well-grown
student body of mine and I'm always welcome to more students getting involved
with the station. Click [here](/pages/get-involved) to find out how to get
involved with the station.

As a healthy, wealthy, handsome, desired man, I have access to over 35,000
students. I am aware that I'm Gru, and the students are my beloved minions. If
your company would like to provide prizes and additional minions then I would
love to hear from you.
