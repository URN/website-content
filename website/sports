# Sports

As a healthy young athlete I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine.

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, Iâ€™ll put on an ice pack while
doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice
pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated
gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating
gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with
little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look
older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.
